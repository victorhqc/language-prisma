Adds syntax highlighting for Prisma in Atom.

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add
snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.

This package was built using [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/). If you're curious about the AST implementation, or found a bug in the Syntax itself (not the colors), go to [tree-sitter-prisma](https://github.com/victorhqc/tree-sitter-prisma)
